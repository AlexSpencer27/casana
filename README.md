# Peak Detection Neural Network Interview Question

## Problem Statement
You are given a signal that contains two peaks. The signal is generated by adding two peaks with ramps and a complex noise signal composed of multiple sine waves. Your task is to implement a neural network that predicts the positions of the two peaks and the midpoint between them.

The predictions should be output as a tensor of shape (batch_size, 3) where each row contains the predicted positions of the first peak, midpoint, and second peak. The final results should be visualized using the provided plotting code.

## Project Structure
```
.
├── config.yaml           # Configuration file
├── pyproject.toml       # Poetry dependencies
└── src/
    ├── config/          # Configuration loading
    ├── utils/           # Utility functions (signal generation, peak detection, plotting)
    └── train.py         # Main training script
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyYAML

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install Poetry and dependencies:
```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

4. Install PyTorch separately (due to packaging constraints):
```bash
pip install torch
```

## Configuration
The project uses a YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) at the root directory. You can modify the following parameters:

```yaml
training:
  num_epochs: 2000
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 0.0001

signal:
  length: 2048
  sampling_rate: 1024

visualization:
  num_predictions: 32
```

## Usage
With your virtual environment activated, run:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

## Implementation Notes
### Constraints
- You may modify the hyper parameters in `config.yaml`
- You may modify the model architecture and training loop
- You may add preprocessing steps if necessary
- You may add to the visualization code, but do not remove the existing plots
- Do not update the signal generation or batch generation code
- The solution should be implemented as a neural network, not manual feature detection

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with PyTorch installation, please refer to the official PyTorch installation guide at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for platform-specific instructions.
