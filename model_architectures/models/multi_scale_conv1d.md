# Multi-Scale Conv1D Model

> TL;DR: The efficient multitasker - it processes signals at multiple scales simultaneously, like having multiple pairs of eyes looking at different levels of detail all at once.

## Overview
The Multi-Scale Conv1D model is a streamlined architecture that processes signals at multiple temporal scales using parallel convolutional branches. It combines efficient feature extraction with skip connections to achieve robust peak detection while maintaining computational efficiency.
